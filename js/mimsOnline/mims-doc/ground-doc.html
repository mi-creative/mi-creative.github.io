<h1>Ground Module</h1><br><br>@{name} ground {position}<br><br>This module represents a fixed material point.<br><br>Physical Parameters: none<br><br>Position may be expressed either as a scalar (e.g. 1) or a vector in brackets (e.g. [1 0 2]), in which case the z coordinate serves as the base position for the 1D physics and x-y serve to position the material point in a rendered 3D space.<br><br>Examples:<br>@g1 ground 0. (in this case x and y coordinates default to 0)<br>@g2 ground [0 0.3 1.3] (x-y coordinates that can be used for rendering)<br>

@{name} mass {inertia} {opt: gravity} {position} {velocity}<br><br>This module represents a punctual mass.<br><br>Physical Parameters: inertia of the mass module and (optional) gravity<br><br>Position may be expressed either as a scalar (e.g. 1) or a vector in brackets (e.g. [1 0 2]), in which case the z coordinate serves as the base position for the 1D physics and x-y serve to position the material point in a rendered 3D space.<br><br>Velocity is expressed in metres per second (only useful for z dimension).<br><br>Examples:<br>@m1 mass 1. 1. 0. (in this case x and y coordinated default to 0)<br>@m2 mass 1. 0.0001 [0 4 6.3] 0.1 (mass with gravity and x-y coordinates that can be used for rendering)<br>

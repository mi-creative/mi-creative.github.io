@{name} ground {position}<br>

This module represents a fixed material point.<br>

Physical Parameters: none<br>

Position may be expressed either as a scalar (e.g. 1) or a vector in brackets (e.g. [1 0 2]), in which case the z coordinate serves as the base position for the 1D physics and x-y serve to position the material point in a rendered 3D space.<br>
<br>
Examples:<br>
@g1 ground 0. (in this case x and y coordinates default to 0)<br>
@g2 ground [0 0.3 1.3] (x-y coordinates that can be used for rendering)<br>

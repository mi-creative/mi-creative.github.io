<h1>Bounded Non-linear Contact</h1><br><br>@{name} nlContact @{m1} @{m2} {stiffness} {nl3stiffness} {stiffnessMax} {damping} {opt: thresh}<br><br>This non linear contact connects two material points {@m1} and {@m2} with a viscoelastic collision interaction, using a cubic term.<br>This is useful, as it allows implementing collisions that are soft at low speeds, and become hard at higher speeds.<br>The equivalent stiffness term is clipped beyond the {stiffness_lim} parameter, meaning the interaction will revert to a linear behaviour in extreme ranges (rather than exploding!).<br><br><br>Physical Parameters: linear stiffness, cubic stiffness, bounding stiffness, damping and optional threshold distance.<br><br>Example:<br>@g1 ground 0.<br>@m1 mass 1.2 0. 0.1<br>@sp nlSpring3 @g1 @m1 0.01 0.0001 0.001<br>

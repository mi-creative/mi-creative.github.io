<h1>Welcome to MIMS Online</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p><i>(early early) pre-Beta Version</i></p>
<p><strong>tested in Chrome</strong></p>


<p>
    The Mass Interaction Model Scripter allows you to describe physical models with a simple and concise syntax. It then
    parses the models and is capable of generating executable DSP code for simulating the model.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, you can visualise the model in a 3D view, and generate certain structures such as strings and meshes.
</p>
<p>
    As of yet, MIMS_online compiles to Faust DSP and gen~ dsp code (for Max/MSP).
</p>
<p>
    This is an pre-alpha version, so be kind to the many bugs you might find and please report them to the MI team.
</p>
<p>
    Happy modelling !
